# This config contains behaviour data: Thread allocation, allowed fields for lookup, limits for arguments etc.
#
# The behaviour config is normally controlled by developers and is part of the code repository.
# Sensitive information such as machine names and user/passwords should not be part of this config.
#
# It will be automatically merged with the environment config when accessed through the
# application config system.

# The entries below are just place holders.

# There should be a corresponding `-environment.yaml`-file with the structure below, but with real values.
# The entries in the environment-YAML will override the ones in the behaviour-YAML. The sole purpose of having the
# structure in the behaviour-YAML is to document what needs to be defined in the environment.
